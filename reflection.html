                            Mari Marks encaustic and mixed media works consistently evoke a sense of suspended time. Marks employs the plastic qualities and translucent properties of wax as a medium in which to form textures and suspend materials and pigments in ways that elicit memory.

                            In her earlier series such as Intervals and Of Time, Nature, and the Space Between, Marks embedded ginko leaves and other natural elements in layers of beeswax and pigment as means to create compositions of rhythmic regularity, and to induce a quality of recollection.  Her choice of the ginko leaf to symbolize memory is materially matched by the way she floats these elements in the liminal space between surface and ground; vitality and decay. Marks creates a quality of golden luminescence with layers of wax, which diffuse and refract the light.  This captures a mood that suggests discrete experiences of time, place, and emotional resonance that have a parallel with natural phenomena and cycles.  She explains her interest in working this way as, "nature heals and sustains me."

                            Marks' recent Sedimentary Series reveals her continuing interest in natural materials and their expressive potentials.  It simultaneously suggests her move away from more fragile and ephemeral elements and attraction to such earth based elements as graphite and soil.  She uses these materials--graphite, red brick clay granules, ashes, and asphalt--as finely ground substances, suspended in solutions of denatured alcohol, water, and citrus solvent that are applied and allowed to dry.  Then she uses heat and light to manipulate these mediums, which results in patterns of melting and flow.  The more minimal compositions, such as Quartet, reveal her attraction to fundamental textural exploration and mark making.  In others, like the diptych Nocturne, Marks suggests the duality of landscape over time as it moves from dark and scabrous to luminous and delicately incised.  With its juxtaposition of convoluted and simple planes and transition from accumulation to pared down, this work also reveals Marks' sculptural interests.

                           The Sediments and Circles portion of this series is alternately assertive and somber, depending on her use of color and the viscosity of the wax. Each segment of the gridded composition contains a textured circle, created with heat held in place until the wax flows.  Some, like Sediments and Circles - Red, are bold and playful, while others like Sedimentary Series - Graphite and Sediments and Circles-Natural, suggest celestial or microscopic worlds.

                          Marks describes how her work in this series was influenced by the events of 9/11, and how the layers of small particles that comprise these paintings suggest what is lost and what remains.  It is meaningful that such manmade disaster is paralleled in the natural processes that create Marks' primary materials and form the core of her work.  Her media and creative process become metaphors for her sense of personal affinity with the solidity yet ever shifting disposition of nature's materials and cycles.
